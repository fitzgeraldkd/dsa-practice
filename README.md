# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

## In Progress / To Do

- [ ] Add comments with time complexity to each algorithm
- [X] Add tests to CTCI Chapter 2 problems
- [ ] Add tests to `LinkedList` class
- [ ] Add tests to `Graph` class
- [ ] Build `Queue` class and associated tests
- [ ] Complete LC #106 (in Trees and Graphs)
- [ ] Complete CTCI 1.09
- [X] Complete CTCI 2.04
- [ ] Complete CTCI 4.03
- [ ] Add check to 1.06 that skips compression if new string will not be shorter
